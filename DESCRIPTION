Description: RIC package automates search for RBP from cRIC (RNA-interactome 
    capture)proteomics experiments. It requires tabular input (i.e. peptides.txt 
    files) generated by MaxQuant software for quantitative analysis of raw mass 
    spectrometry data. It uses QFeatures infrastructure to handle and process 
    high-throughput mass spectrometry data. Functions provided in the package 
    enable bacth correction and peptide aggregation as well as vizualization for
    intensity distribition across replicates, moderated statistical analysis 
    adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing and scatter and volcano plots 
    visualizations, scatter and volcano plots.
