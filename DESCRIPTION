Description: RIC package automates search for RBP from cRIC (RNA-interactome capture)
   proteomics experiments.It requires tabular input (i.e. peptides.txt files) generated by 
    MaxQuant software for quantitative analysis of raw mass spectrometry data. 
    It uses QFeatures infrastructure to handle and process high-throughput mass
    spectrometry data. Functions provided in the package enable bacth correction 
    and peptide aggregation as well as vizualization for intensity distribition 
    across replicates, moderated statistical analysis adjusted for multiple 
    hypothesis testing and scatter and volcano plots visualizations, scatter and 
    volcano plots.
    Finally, semi-quantitative...
